# Week-1
As part of my internship, I’m working on a project to create a Crop Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning. The goal is to help farmers make smarter decisions about fertilizer use to improve crop growth while minimizing waste.

Here’s what I’m doing:

	1.	Understanding the Data: I collect and study information like soil quality, crop types, and weather conditions to see how they affect fertilizer needs.
	2.	Teaching the System: I use machine learning to train the system to recognize patterns and figure out the best fertilizer options for different situations.
	3.	Making It Farmer-Friendly: I’m designing the system to be simple and easy to use so farmers can input their details and get clear recommendations.

This project is exciting because it combines technology with real-world farming challenges. It’s all about helping farmers grow healthier crops, save resources, and support sustainable agriculture.
